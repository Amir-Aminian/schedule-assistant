# schedule assistant

- ## What is it?

    It is a simple schedule table with a timeline for each day. You can see your tasks and the duration for each one for a whole week on a single page. You have the option to manage your schedule by adding new tasks or editing the existing ones. You can pick different colors for each task for better visibility on the page. But first, you have to create a new account through the sign up page. All information would be stored in local storage for now.

- ## Why did I make it?

    I had decided to build the Pac-Man game Using HTML, CSS, and JS for my first project. But my coach recommended a simple game as I had to learn everything along with the project. So, we decided to build a simple board game named Gomoku, also called Five in a Row.
    
- ## What is next?

    Currently to play the game there should be two players. I would like to implement the PC as one of the players. So the game could be played even with one player at a time.
    
- ## Built with:

    React, JavaScript, Material UI, Chart.js, React Hook Form, HTML and CSS

# schedule assistant

- ## What is it?

    It is a simple schedule table with a timeline for each day. You can see your tasks and the duration for each one for a whole week on a single page. You have the option to manage your schedule by adding new tasks or editing the existing ones. You can pick different colors for each task for better visibility on the page. But first, you have to create a new account through the sign up page. All information would be stored in local storage for now.

- ## Why did I make it?

    I often face the problem of managing my schedule. I have to go through a couple of calendars, my to-do list for the day, and sometimes my emails to find a time for a new task. So I came up with the idea to have all daily tasks in one place. And give it a perspective by showing the duration of each task throughout the day. That was how I decided to build a simple schedule assistant.
    
- ## What is next?

    Currently to play the game there should be two players. I would like to implement the PC as one of the players. So the game could be played even with one player at a time.
